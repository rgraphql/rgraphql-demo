# Demo

This is a GraphiQL demo for rGraphQL - everything is real-time, and query changes are applied instantly. A websocket is used to talk to the [Go server](https://github.com/rgraphql/rgraphql-demo-server).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
